Product Multilingual Search Pro V3 – User Manual
1. Overview

Product Multilingual Search Pro V3 is an advanced Odoo 18 module that enhances product search functionality by:

Combining product names in all installed languages.

Supporting multi-word partial search.

Performing full-text ranking for relevance (most relevant products appear first).

Maintaining a cache table for ultra-fast search, even for catalogs with 100k+ products.

Automatically updating the cache via triggers and optional daily cron jobs.

Optimized for website and backend product searches.

2. Installation
Step 1: Add Module to Odoo

Copy product_multilang_search_pro_v3.zip to your Odoo addons directory.

Extract the ZIP (optional; Odoo can read ZIP directly).

odoo/addons/product_multilang_search_pro_v3/
Step 2: Update Apps List

Log in as Administrator in Odoo.

Go to Apps → Update Apps List.

Search for Product Multilingual Search Pro V3.

Click Install.

✅ After installation, the module automatically creates the product_search_cache table and adds the necessary triggers.

3. Configuration

No special configuration is required for basic usage.

Optional Configurations:

Installed Languages:

Go to Settings → Translations → Languages.

Make sure all languages you want for product names are installed.

Cron Job Frequency (for large catalogs):

Go to Settings → Technical → Automation → Scheduled Actions.

Look for Refresh Product Search Cache.

Adjust interval (default: every 1 day) or number of calls.

Product Names:

Ensure products have names translated in the installed languages.

Translations can be added via the Translate button on product forms.

4. Usage
4.1 Backend Product Search

Go to Sales → Products → Products.

Use the search bar to type keywords in any installed language.

Results:

Products are automatically searched across all languages.

Multi-word searches are supported.

Search is case-insensitive and supports partial matches.

4.2 Website Product Search

Go to your Odoo website (Shop page).

Enter product keywords in English, Bengali, or any installed language.

Search results are:

Ranked by relevance using PostgreSQL full-text ranking.

Most relevant products appear first.

Multi-word search supported (e.g., “shirt cotton”).

✅ This ensures Google-like relevance in search results.

5. Data & Cache Table

The module creates a dedicated table: product_search_cache:

Column	Description
product_id	Product ID (primary key)
name_search_all	Combined product names from all installed languages
name_search_all_lower	Lowercase version of name_search_all for fast search
name_search_tsv	PostgreSQL tsvector for full-text ranking

Indexes:

Trigram index on name_search_all_lower for fast ILIKE searches.

Full-text index on name_search_tsv for relevance ranking.

Automatic Updates:

On product create/update via trigger.

Cron job (daily by default) refreshes the cache for large catalogs.

6. Best Practices

Use proper translations: Ensure each product has a translated name in all active languages.

Batch updates: For catalogs with 100k+ products, adjust the cron frequency and/or run manually via Scheduled Actions.

Optimize PostgreSQL: Ensure pg_trgm extension is installed (the module will attempt to enable it).

Reindex after major updates: After importing many products or changing translations, run the cron job to refresh the cache.

7. Troubleshooting
Issue	Solution
Website search doesn’t find some products	Make sure product names have translations for the relevant language. Run the cron to refresh cache.
Slow search on large catalogs	Ensure trigram index exists and pg_trgm extension is enabled. Run batch refresh cron.
Relevance order seems off	PostgreSQL full-text ranking uses simple dictionary (simple). Multi-language ranking may vary slightly.
8. Advanced Usage

Custom Search Queries:

You can query the cache directly:

SELECT product_id, ts_rank(name_search_tsv, plainto_tsquery('simple', 'shirt cotton')) AS rank
FROM product_search_cache
WHERE name_search_all_lower ILIKE '%shirt%'
ORDER BY rank DESC;

Extend to new languages:

Add a new language in Settings → Translations → Languages.

Update product translations.

Run cron to refresh cache.

Modify ranking:

Adjust PostgreSQL ts_rank parameters in website_sale_product.py for different search weighting.
